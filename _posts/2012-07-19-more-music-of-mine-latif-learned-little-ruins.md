title: More Music of Mine - Latif Learned - Little Ruins
category: projects
---

*Little Ruins* is an album that I wrote and recorded in 2006, in Upstate New York, Montpelier, France, and Boston, MA. I wrote it under the moniker "Latif Learned", which strangely enough is an actual way to interpret my real name.

In spite of my lenghy previous post about the "Demo" and "Conversations" EP, I'm not going to write much about these songs. I alluded to this in the last post, but I think it's generally best if you come to your own conclusions without my biases operating on you.

I hope you enjoy it, and feel free to share it. I've decided to release the album under a [Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org) license. Details at the bottom of the page.
