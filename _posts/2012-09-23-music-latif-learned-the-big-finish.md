title: Music - Latif Learned - The Big Finish
category: projects
---

The final album that I recorded as Latif Learned was called The Big Finish. I wrote and recorded it in a month in February 2007 as part of the [RPM Challenge](http://rpmchallenge.com/index.php?option=com_comprofiler&task=userProfile&user=690&Itemid=296). The album is aptly named since I decided to "retire" the Latif Learned persona after 2007.

I'm making the songs available for download here â€“ you can't do that over on the RPM site.
