Let's talk about your information. I mean your basic details: name, email
address, gender, address, phone number. This is the kind of information that
most people will freely give out. You make an acquaintance, you give them your
phone number. You sell something on Craigslist, you might give your address so
that the purchaser can come and pick it up. For most people, not a week goes by
that you don't hand away some way to communicate with you or identify you.

Since you freely give this information out, you might assume that there's
nothing inherently valuable in it. It's not as though your friends
or coworkers are going to make money from having your phone number or knowing
where you live. How are people going to know whether they should friend you
on Facebook or follow you on Twitter if they don't know all about your obsession
with Metroid cosplay? But this information _is_ valuable. In most places on
the internet it's the only currency you've got.

Big sites (Google, Facebook, um.. basically everything that you
use but don't "pay" for) tend to serve the same function that magazines serve:
to deliver customers to advertisers. Don't be silly and think that the purpose
of Vogue is to tell you about fashion. It's to tell fashion companies about you,
or at least to get their wares in front of your face. In the same way, Google
isn't about getting you accurate search results. It's about allowing advertisers
to show you targeted advertisements based on those search results. 

Facebook is the largest marketing database on the planet. You just _gave_ them all the
information they need to be valued at 2 zillion dollars. All for the convenience
of not having to put people's birthdays in your own calendar or call them to
invite them to a party. Or, you know, to let potentially good-looking strangers
know how deeply you love Bon Iver.

If you have any doubt about the point of Google, Facebook, Vogue, whatever, take a
look at the latest [Advertising Age](http://adage.com). It's best to get a print
copy, because then you can see the ads. Yes, there are advertisements in a
magazine about advertisements. Who's doing the advertising? Mostly magazines.
Cond&eacute; Nast, for example. And they say things like "You want to market to
Northeastern males between 24 and 35? We'll give 'em to you on a platter".

Let it sink in for a moment: 

> I am not a customer, I am a product.

Which gets me back to my original point: why are you just giving your
information away? You should guard it ferociously. You're not getting something 
for free, you're making an exchange. 

"Okay", you might be saying, "but what if I don't care about advertisements? I'm
really good at ignoring them." Great. Good for you. But let me pose one other
question: is your time worth nothing? Because the time you spend recycling junk
mail, calling to be taken off of mailing lists, filtering spam emails, fielding
telemarketing calls, that's time you could be spending doing something that you
love, or at least making money. That time adds up. Think long-term: it's what
advertisers do, and you're playing their game whether you like it or not.

So if you leave with one notion you didn't come with, let it be this: your basic
information is currency, and it's just as valuable as dollars and cents.
