Exploration Slideshow was my first solo album. I wrote and recorded it in the summer of 2004 in New Haven, CT, while working as a summer IT coordinator for [Explo](http://www.explo.org). The album was entirely conceived, written, performed, and recorded by me over the span of about 7 weeks.

I'm posting all the tracks from this album, and will be posting all of my other music up here as well. At some point I may post the lyrics as well. Do with this music what you will - remix, put it in your slideshow, whatever. I hope you enjoy it.
