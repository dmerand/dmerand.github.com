I've done some projects over the years which never really got properly written up. Some are art projects, some are things I did for work that we decided to open-source, and some are just fun things that I couldn't help but make. At some point I might make fuller blog posts about this stuff, but I thought it might be nice to start with a small catalog so that they don't get lost to time.

- The [Enigma Explorer](https://enigmas.ploration.org) ([source](https://bitbucket.org/explo/enigma/src/master/)) uses Elixir, Phoenix and LiveView to generate art inspired by Seymour Papert and Cynthia Solomon's LOGO language, which was my first exposure to coding.
- [The Faces of EXPLO](https://lab.explo.org/facesofexplo/#) is an exploration (pun so very intended) into generative image composition. This was powered by some [shell scripting and ImageMagick fun](https://gist.github.com/dmerand/2490678).
- The [Markov Words](https://github.com/exploration/markov_words) Ruby Gem uses Markov chains to make English-sounding words that aren't (usually) _real_ English words. Actually, the gem allows you to use any dictionary, so you could just as easily make "Elvish-sounding" or "Klingon-sounding" words or whatever, just by feeding it a different dictionary. We use this at EXPLO sometimes to [generate passwords](https://lab.explo.org/password) with a fun little [Elm app](https://bitbucket.org/explo/password-generator/src/master/).
- [My Pile of Shell Scripts](https://github.com/dmerand/dlm-dot-bin) that I use on a daily basis. I actually keep this up-to-date. It's my most popular repository on GitHub, with a whopping 19 stars at the time of publication. Some favorites include a [dpaste frontend](https://github.com/dmerand/dlm-dot-bin/blob/master/dpaste), WSL versions of the Mac utilities [pbcopy](https://github.com/dmerand/dlm-dot-bin/blob/master/pbcopy) and [pbpaste](https://github.com/dmerand/dlm-dot-bin/blob/master/pbpaste), and [tsvfmt](https://github.com/dmerand/dlm-dot-bin/blob/master/tsvfmt)/[tsv2html](https://github.com/dmerand/dlm-dot-bin/blob/master/tsv2html) which make TSVs easier on the command line.
- [Quarantine Poem Anthology](http://quarantine-poem-anthology.herokuapp.com/) was an early and quickly aborted attempt to reconcile stay-at-home Feelings. It is also a fun [Sinatra app](https://github.com/dmerand/quarantine-poem-anthology) that explores using Airtable as the CMS for a web site, with basic caching. I did a similar thing for [Homeschool Resources](http://merand-homeschool-resources.herokuapp.com/) with Google Docs as the backend instead of Airtable, but I never published the source for that app.
- [Compliment Bot](https://github.com/exploration/compliment-bot) was how I learned about Arduino and GPIO programming on the Raspberry Pi. It's a robot that gives you compliments and prints them out on a receipt! Later, I converted it to draw random mazes, and also give you compliments, at which point I changed the name to aMazeBot. PS: you can visit the robot online at <https://robot.lab.explo.org>.
- Along similar lines, [EXTROVRT](https://github.com/exploration/EXTROVRT) was a "telepresence robot" that was basically a phone or tablet holder that you could drive through a [web interface](https://github.com/exploration/EXTROVRT-Control). This was another Arduino project, experimenting with MQTT via <https://io.adafruit.com>. This project also had some fun [3d-printed design elements](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1419043).
- A bunch of custom quadcopter designs: [Micro X](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:972795), [Spiral Arm](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:966442), and [Dreamcatcher](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:966385), all of which use electronics pulled from a Syma X1 quad. I'm especially proud of those designs because they are all parametric - the CAD is code too! This project was also where I learned how to properly use and tune a 3D printer.
- A DIY [CNC Pendant](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:335958) that works with a Shopbot. The Adafruit Leonardo was an early Arduino that allowed keyboard emulation, which is what I used here to make it control a CNC machine.
- A [Drill Press Laser Centering Device](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:822258) inspired by [Dan Gelbart](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYA1VjSKXgNVh03wjw_HSRA).
- Fully 3d-printable [paper rollers](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1404307) that allow you to re-use all of that Amazon packing paper as an infinite-scroll paper tabletop.
- A series of soldering fan [fume extractors](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1501388), which can be battery- or wall-powered. One design has a very fancy cell pattern inspired by [NERVOUS System](https://n-e-r-v-o-u-s.com).
