When you make sourdough starter, you have to "feed" it periodically, which involves throwing a fair portion of the starter out. Don't throw it away - use it to make pancakes! Or muffins. I'll post some muffins later.

I used [this method](http://www.breadtopia.com/whole-grain-sourdough/) to create my starter, and it worked quite well!

# Ingredients

-   3 eggs worth of egg replacer, or 1/4 cup applesauce.
-   1 cup soy milk (you might need more)
-   2 cups sourdough starter
-   1 cup all-purpose flour
-   3/4 cup whole wheat flour
-   1 teaspoon baking soda
-   2 teaspoons baking powder
-   1 1/2 teaspoons salt
-   1/4 cup granulated sugar
-   1/4 cup earth balance, melted

# Procedure

1. Mix up that egg replacer if you're using it.
2. Add milk and sourdough starter.
3. Sift together flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and sugar; add to
the egg-like mixture, mixing _pretty_ well, but don't overmix. You want the batter to be fluid, but not liquid.
4. Stir in the melted butter.
5. Lightly grease a hot griddle (or use a non-stick pan with no grease). don't make that griddle so hot that you burn your pancakes!
6. Pour the batter onto the griddle and cook until light brown, turning once after maybe 2-3 minutes. My mom always used to say "Wait until you see bubbles in the middle of the pancake", but I'm not sure that method is reliable. Your mileage may vary.
